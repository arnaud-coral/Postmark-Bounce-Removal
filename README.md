# üìß Postmark Bounce Removal Script

This script interacts with the Postmark API to remove bounces based on the domain and bounce type provided.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Store your API token in a file named `api_token.conf`.

## üåü Features
- **Domain Filtering**: Target specific domains for bounce removal.
- **Bounce Type Selection**: Choose the types of bounces you wish to process, or opt to handle all bounce types.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Safely preview which records would be removed without actually making deletions.
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed logging to troubleshoot or understand the script's operations.
- **Result Output**: Generates a CSV (`result.csv`) containing the results of the operation with each email's `DeletionStatus`.

## üöÄ Usage
Execute the script with various parameters to customize its behavior:

```
./script_name.sh --domains=example.com,example2.com
./script_name.sh --file=domains.conf
./script_name.sh --domains=example.com --dry-run
./script_name.sh --debug
```

## üìù Parameters

- `--domains=`: Comma-separated list of domains to process. You can even use 'all' to process all domains.
- `--file=`: Alternatively, provide a file named `domains.conf` with one domain listed on each line.
- `--dry-run`: Simulate the bounce removal process without performing any real deletions.
- `--debug`: Runs the script in debug mode, outputting detailed logs.

## üî¢ Bounce Types

You'll be prompted to select a bounce type from the following list:
1. AddressChange
2. AutoResponder
3. BadEmailAddress
4. Blocked
5. ChallengeVerification
